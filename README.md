# docker-monolithic-lamp
In this repository I show the procedure of creating a LAMP (Linux - Apache - mySQL - PHP) environment 
for my hackable webshop mallowz. <br/><br/>

The environment is built as a monolith so that it can be conveniently downloaded as an image and started 
without having to worry about the interaction of the different components and services. <br/><br/>

It was also a good exercise for me to install and configure a complete environment on the basis of an ubuntu 
image instead of just using ready-made images from the Docker Hub.
